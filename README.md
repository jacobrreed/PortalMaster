# PortalMaster
Simple helper addon to cast mage teleport and portal spells in World of Warcraft.

## Description
Fork of https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/portalmaster which is no longer maintained, tried opening a pull request but the author seems to be inactive.

Tired of fiddly flyout menus to cast your portals? Simply not enough key bindings for all of your fancy teleports? Introducing PortalMaster, the new favorite of every mage.

With this addon a mage can open up a simple dialog where they can type the name of the intended destination. Immediately when a match is found you can hit the enter once to confirm it is the right one and second time to cast it. Additionally only teleports and portals that you can cast are displayed.

### Usage

To begin with you must assign a key bind for the dialog. In case one has not been set the addon should prompt for it. If not, go to the Key Bindings menu from the Game Menu (hint: press ESC) and then browse to AddOns category. From there you will find the option to bind a key.

After you are all set with the key binding you can hit it whenever you like provided you are only out of combat and start warping around the world like a madman!

If you prefer using a chat command to display PortalMaster you can open the dialog by typing **/portalmaster**, **/pm** or **/port** in chat. Any parameters given to the command will also perform search with that value, for example **/portalmaster exodar** displays the dialog with *exodar* in the search field.

## Dependencies
PortalMaster uses Ace3 which is included in the /libs directory.
